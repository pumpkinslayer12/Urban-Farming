# School Urban Farming Framework

# Overview

The School Urban Farming Framework is a comprehensive guide for establishing sustainable urban farms in schools. Starting with a needs assessment, it outlines the necessary resources and potential challenges for both outdoor and indoor farming setups.

The guide details funding strategies, crop selection, land preparation, and implementation, emphasizing organic practices. It also covers training, water management, and harvest techniques for food safety and high-quality produce.

Furthermore, the framework provides guidance on monitoring and managing pests, with specific strategies for various crops. Finally, it offers tools for evaluating program success and areas for improvement, ensuring ongoing farm development and success.

Overall, this framework equips schools with essential information and resources to start and manage an urban farm effectively.

# Needs Assessment

# Program Implementation

Implementing a successful urban farm program entails thorough planning and execution. This phase breathes life into your plans and sets the foundation for continuous growth and success. It involves the execution of sustainable growing practices, initial training for involved individuals, and ensuring safe and sufficient water. Let's delve into each of these areas.

## Sustainable and Organic Growing Practices

Here are some common practices:

- **Crop Rotation:** Helps improve soil health and mitigates pest and disease buildup.
- **Composting:** Enhances soil health, reduces waste, and is made from organic materials like vegetable food scraps and yard waste.
- **Cover Cropping:** Aids in soil health improvement, soil erosion reduction, and weed control.
- **Natural Pest Management:** Involves techniques like companion planting and beneficial insects attraction.
- **Irrigation Management:** Encompasses water-saving techniques like drip irrigation and mulching.
- **Minimizing Chemical Use:** Advocates for reduced synthetic fertilizers and pesticides use, favoring organic methods.
- **Soil Testing:** Regular tests to monitor soil fertility and ensure it's healthy and supportive of plant growth.
- **Crop Selection:** Considers local growing conditions to minimize inputs and increase yields.

## Initial Training for Students and Staff

Training should cover:

1. **Basic plant biology and physiology**
2. **Soil science and hydroponics**
3. **Urban farming practices**
4. **Irrigation setup and maintenance**
5. **Farm maintenance**
6. **Harvesting and post-harvest handling**

## Ensuring Safe and Sufficient Water

Clean water is essential for plant growth. Consider filtration for municipal water sources or rainwater use. Let's look at how to handle both water sources.

### Water Filtration from Municipal Water Sources

1. **Choose filtration system**: A multi-stage filtration system.
2. **Gather materials**: Storage tank, pump, filters, tubing, activated carbon, etc.
3. **Build the system**: Connect sediment filter and activated carbon filter in series.
4. **Install filters**: Connect to pump and tubing, then tubing to storage tank.
5. **Test the water**: Check for chemical and mineral content.
6. **Use the filtered water**: After water quality verification, use for irrigation.

### Collecting Rainwater

1. **Check rainwater quality**: Do this regularly.
2. **Place rain barrel or storage container**: Position it under a gutter downspout.
3. **Screen the container**: Prevent debris and pests from entering.
4. **Keep the container covered**: Maintain water quality.
5. **Install a spigot or hose bib**: Easy access to the water.

## Basic Plant Growth Guidelines

Let's consider two different systems - raised beds and hydroponics.

**Note:** Hydroponic growing conditions can vary. Research specific plants for best results.

# Progress Monitoring

To ensure the success of your urban farm, proactive monitoring and management of your crops and environment is essential. Key elements to keep an eye on include:

## Key Monitoring Elements

- **Plant Health:** Regularly assess the overall appearance and growth of your plants, looking for signs of stress such as yellowing leaves or stunted growth.
- **Nutrient Levels:** Keep tabs on the pH and nutrient levels in your hydroponic solution or soil to maintain the ideal balance for your plants.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Track temperature, humidity, and light levels, ensuring they remain within the optimal range for each crop.
- **Pest & Disease Surveillance:** Regular inspections for signs of pests (chewed leaves, webbing) and diseases (powdery mildew, root rot) allow early detection and prevention of further spread.

## Pest Management

Effective pest control includes:

- **Prevention:** Enhance sanitation practices and apply crop rotation to minimize pest risk.
- **Natural Controls:** Opt for natural methods such as beneficial insects or diatomaceous earth.
- **Pesticides:** As a last resort, use eco-friendly pesticides, ensuring compliance with local and federal regulations. Consult with local extension services or agricultural experts for recommendations specific to your region.

## Addressing Plant Disorders

Common plant disorders and their management include:

- **Nutrient Deficiency:** Adjust the pH and nutrient levels in your hydroponic solution or soil as needed.
- **Light Stress:** Supply adequate light or modify light intensity to avoid stress.
- **Watering Issues:** Monitor soil moisture levels frequently and modify watering as required.
- **Pest Infestations:** Implement the strategies listed under "Pest Management" for pest control.
- **Disease Outbreaks:** Swiftly implement preventative measures and treat diseased plants to prevent disease spread.

## Quality Harvesting & Food Safety Techniques

Ensuring a high-quality, efficient, and safe harvest involves:

1. **Shaded Produce Staging:** Shield delicate produce from heat by staging it in a shaded area pre-wash to minimize spoilage.
2. **Spray Area:** Equip your space with hoses or other washing equipment for thorough produce cleaning prior to packing.
3. **Cleaning & Hydrocooling Dunk Tanks:** Quick clean and cool produce using dunk tanks. This preserves produce quality and freshness, reducing spoilage risk.
4. **Drying Area:** Designate an area for removing excess water post-wash to prevent harmful microorganisms' growth. Wire top tables and a salad spinner are useful.
5. **Packing Counter/Table:** Maintain a clean and sanitized table or counter for packing produce into distribution containers.
6. **Cold Storage:** Maintain appropriate temperature and humidity in your cold storage to extend produce shelf life.

# Urban Farm Program Evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation of your urban farming initiative is pivotal to gauge its effectiveness and discover improvement areas. Here are the key steps for a thorough assessment:

## Evaluation Steps

1. **Crop Yield & Quality Assessment:** Gauge the overall farm performance by examining the yield and quality of your crops. This will help you identify which crops are flourishing and which need attention.
2. **Financial Analysis:** Scrutinize your expenses and revenues to understand the economic sustainability of your urban farm. This financial insight will guide your decisions about the program's future.
3. **Community Impact Evaluation:** Conduct surveys among customers, neighbors, and other stakeholders to capture their views on your urban farm. This step gives you insight into the social and environmental implications of your program.
4. **Environmental Sustainability Examination:** Scrutinize the energy, water, and resource usage of your farm to assess its overall sustainability.
5. **Farm Management & Operations Review:** Reflect on your processes, protocols, and procedures for potential improvement areas and efficiency enhancement.

Regular, thorough evaluations will allow you to assess your urban farm program's overall success, make informed decisions about its future, and optimize its impact within your community.
