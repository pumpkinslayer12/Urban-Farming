# Crop Selection and Land Preparation

Whether you plan to engage in traditional outdoor farming using raised beds or take the route of hydroponic farming, two crucial steps to consider in urban school farming are crop selection and land preparation. This comprehensive guide provides a roadmap to help you determine what crops to grow and how to prepare your land to get the best yield possible.

## Crop Selection: Maximizing Yield and Suitability

The crops you select will directly impact the success of your urban farming project. They should align with growing conditions, local climate, soil quality, and market demand. Research the local market to understand the demand for different crops and evaluate local growing conditions to ensure you select the most suitable crops.

For traditional farming in Indiana, consider leafy greens like lettuce, spinach, and kale, herbs such as basil, parsley, and cilantro, root crops like carrots, beets, and radishes, and popular crops such as tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and strawberries. For hydroponic farming, stick to the leafy greens, herbs, and popular crops, but also consider growing microgreens like wheatgrass, pea shoots, and sunflower sprouts.

## Land Preparation: Setting the Stage for Growth

Land preparation, whether for outdoor raised beds or indoor/outdoor hydroponic systems, is critical in establishing a thriving urban farm. It includes selecting the right site, evaluating and preparing the soil or system, and ensuring adequate light, drainage, and nutrient availability.

### Outdoor Raised Bed Preparation

For outdoor raised beds, begin by assessing your site and preparing the soil. Clear vegetation, till the soil, improve soil fertility and structure with compost or other organic matter, and test the soil's pH and nutrient levels. Build the raised beds using sturdy materials and install a drip irrigation system for efficient watering. Then, amend the soil in the raised beds, add mulch to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Don't forget to install supports for tall crops and test your irrigation system.

### Indoor or Outdoor Hydroponic System Preparation

For hydroponic systems, start with a site assessment considering factors like light, temperature, and water access. Set up your irrigation system, construct your hydroponic system, and fill the reservoirs with nutrient solution as per the manufacturer's instructions. Once your system is set up, plant your seeds or seedlings and monitor the system regularly to ensure optimal growing conditions. Test your irrigation system to ensure it functions properly.
