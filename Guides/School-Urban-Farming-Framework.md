# Progress Monitoring

To ensure the success of your urban farm, proactive monitoring and management of your crops and environment is essential. Key elements to keep an eye on include:

## Key Monitoring Elements

- **Plant Health:** Regularly assess the overall appearance and growth of your plants, looking for signs of stress such as yellowing leaves or stunted growth.
- **Nutrient Levels:** Keep tabs on the pH and nutrient levels in your hydroponic solution or soil to maintain the ideal balance for your plants.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Track temperature, humidity, and light levels, ensuring they remain within the optimal range for each crop.
- **Pest & Disease Surveillance:** Regular inspections for signs of pests (chewed leaves, webbing) and diseases (powdery mildew, root rot) allow early detection and prevention of further spread.

## Pest Management

Effective pest control includes:

- **Prevention:** Enhance sanitation practices and apply crop rotation to minimize pest risk.
- **Natural Controls:** Opt for natural methods such as beneficial insects or diatomaceous earth.
- **Pesticides:** As a last resort, use eco-friendly pesticides, ensuring compliance with local and federal regulations. Consult with local extension services or agricultural experts for recommendations specific to your region.

## Addressing Plant Disorders

Common plant disorders and their management include:

- **Nutrient Deficiency:** Adjust the pH and nutrient levels in your hydroponic solution or soil as needed.
- **Light Stress:** Supply adequate light or modify light intensity to avoid stress.
- **Watering Issues:** Monitor soil moisture levels frequently and modify watering as required.
- **Pest Infestations:** Implement the strategies listed under "Pest Management" for pest control.
- **Disease Outbreaks:** Swiftly implement preventative measures and treat diseased plants to prevent disease spread.

## Quality Harvesting & Food Safety Techniques

Ensuring a high-quality, efficient, and safe harvest involves:

1. **Shaded Produce Staging:** Shield delicate produce from heat by staging it in a shaded area pre-wash to minimize spoilage.
2. **Spray Area:** Equip your space with hoses or other washing equipment for thorough produce cleaning prior to packing.
3. **Cleaning & Hydrocooling Dunk Tanks:** Quick clean and cool produce using dunk tanks. This preserves produce quality and freshness, reducing spoilage risk.
4. **Drying Area:** Designate an area for removing excess water post-wash to prevent harmful microorganisms' growth. Wire top tables and a salad spinner are useful.
5. **Packing Counter/Table:** Maintain a clean and sanitized table or counter for packing produce into distribution containers.
6. **Cold Storage:** Maintain appropriate temperature and humidity in your cold storage to extend produce shelf life.

# Urban Farm Program Evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation of your urban farming initiative is pivotal to gauge its effectiveness and discover improvement areas. Here are the key steps for a thorough assessment:

## Evaluation Steps
