# Rooftop & Outdoor Hydroponics Garden

# Introduction

The purpose of this report is to present a detailed implementation plan for an urban roof farm in Indianapolis. The goal of this project is to support the Indianapolis Public Schools by providing fresh, healthy produce for their students and staff. This urban roof farm will be designed to grow a variety of crops, including arugula, basil, bush beans, chamomile, cilantro, collard greens, curled mustard greens, dill, kale, lavender, lemon balm, mint, mizuna, oakleaf lettuce, romaine, spinach, and Swiss chard.

This urban roof farm will utilize a Kratky hydroponics system, which is an effective and efficient method of growing crops in an urban setting. Additionally, passive solar tunnels will be used to optimize the available sunlight and maximize crop yields.

To ensure that this urban roof farm aligns with the School Urban Farming Framework, a rigorous site assessment and selection process was conducted. The final site was chosen based on its structural integrity, exposure to sunlight, and accessibility.

The following report will detail the design and planning of the urban roof farm, including the layout, irrigation and drainage systems, and equipment needed. It will also include a budget and financing plan, as well as a marketing and outreach strategy to engage the community and promote the benefits of urban farming. Finally, monitoring and evaluation methods will be discussed to track the success of the project and identify areas for improvement.

Overall, this urban roof farm will not only provide fresh produce for Indianapolis Public Schools but will also serve as a model for future urban farming projects in the area.

# Site Assessment and Selection

The first step in planning an urban rooftop hydroponics farm is to assess and select an appropriate site. In our case, we have a flat roof available for the project, and we will need to evaluate the suitability of the site for supporting the hydroponic system and the crops that we plan to grow.

To determine the suitability of the site, we will need to consider factors such as structural integrity, weight capacity, and access to sunlight and water. Since the rooftop location is exposed to the elements, we will need to ensure that the roof is structurally sound and can support the weight of the hydroponic system, containers, and crops. We will also need to ensure that the site has access to water and electricity, and that we can secure the site to prevent theft or vandalism.

Additionally, we will need to assess the amount of sunlight that the site receives to determine the best layout for the hydroponic system and the crops that we plan to grow. As mentioned earlier, we have access to passive solar tunnels that we can leverage to maximize sunlight exposure. This will help us to optimize the growth of our crops and reduce the need for artificial lighting.

Overall, we believe that the rooftop location is a suitable site for our urban hydroponics farm, and we will work closely with a structural engineer to ensure that the site is safe and secure for both the hydroponic system and the people who will be working on it.

# Design and Planning

Once we have selected an appropriate site for our urban hydroponics farm, the next step is to design and plan the hydroponic system itself. In our case, we will be using a Kratky hydroponic system, which is a passive hydroponic system that does not require pumps or electricity. The Kratky system is well-suited to rooftop gardening because it is relatively simple to set up and requires minimal maintenance.

To design the hydroponic system, we will need to consider several factors, including the size and shape of the containers, the spacing of the plants, and the type of nutrient solution to be used. We will also need to decide on the materials to be used for the containers, the irrigation system, and the passive solar tunnels.

For the containers, we plan to use food-grade plastic buckets that are readily available and relatively inexpensive. We will need to drill holes in the bottom of each bucket to allow excess water to drain, and we will need to cover the top of each bucket with a lid to prevent algae growth and evaporation. We will also need to determine the appropriate spacing for the plants based on the size of the buckets and the types of crops we plan to grow.

For the nutrient solution, we will use a balanced hydroponic fertilizer that contains the necessary nutrients for plant growth. We will need to carefully measure and mix the fertilizer to ensure that the nutrient solution is appropriate for the specific crop we plan to grow.

We will also need to design and build the passive solar tunnels that will be used to maximize sunlight exposure and reduce the need for artificial lighting. The tunnels will be constructed from PVC pipes and covered with clear plastic sheeting. We will need to carefully measure and cut the pipes and sheeting to ensure a snug fit, and we will need to secure the tunnels to the roof to prevent damage from wind or other weather events.

Overall, the design and planning phase of the project will be critical to ensuring the success of our rooftop hydroponics farm. We will need to carefully consider all of the necessary factors, from container design to nutrient solutions and passive solar tunnels, in order to create a system that is efficient, effective, and sustainable in an urban setting.

# Budget and Financing

As with any project, the budget and financing of an urban hydroponics farm can be a critical factor in determining its success. In our case, we have limited funds available, so we will need to be creative in finding ways to acquire the necessary materials and equipment for our project.

One option for reducing costs is to source materials from local businesses or individuals who may have surplus items that they are willing to donate or sell at a reduced cost. We can reach out to local hardware stores, gardening centers, or community organizations to inquire about any surplus materials they may have available.

Another option is to look for used or recycled materials that can be repurposed for our project. For example, we can use old buckets or containers for the hydroponic system, or repurpose other items such as PVC pipes for the passive solar tunnels.

We can also consider crowdfunding or grant opportunities to help finance the project. Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe can be effective in raising awareness and support for the project, while grant opportunities from organizations such as the National Gardening Association or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) can provide much-needed financial support.

In addition, we can explore partnerships with local schools or community organizations to help share the costs of the project. By working with other groups, we can split the cost of materials and equipment, and share the responsibility for maintaining and managing the hydroponic system.

Overall, we believe that with some creativity and resourcefulness, we can finance our urban hydroponics farm without breaking the bank. By leveraging local resources and partnerships, and exploring crowdfunding and grant opportunities, we can acquire the materials and equipment we need to create a successful and sustainable rooftop hydroponics farm in an urban setting.
