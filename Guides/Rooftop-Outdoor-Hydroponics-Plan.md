# Rooftop & Outdoor Hydroponics Garden

# Parameters

The implementation plan will also double as a report to convince people about the details of constructing this urban farm. Provide content for the introduction section. Be confidant. Examples are not acceptable. It must also be succinct. We want to get down to facts. The reader does not care about innovative things involving the city. These are important people giving me access to their land. This is crucial for supporting Indianapolis Public Schools. Write it as if it's a human. The reader doesn't need to know or give a shit about this being on an IPS rooftop as this can also be replicated on the ground.

It will include the following crops: 

*   Arugula
*   Basil
*   Bush beans
*   Chamomile
*   Cilantro
*   Collard greens
*   Curled mustard greens
*   Dill
*   Kale
*   Lavender
*   Lemon balm
*   Mint
*   Mizuna
*   Oakleaf lettuce
*   Romaine
*   Spinach
*   Swiss chard

This will be a Kratky hydroponics farm, leveraging passive solar tunnels and on a roof in an Urban Setting. 

This plan must follow the School Urban Farming Framework. This is not a negotiation. If the content you recommend does not align with the wisdom found in this framework, it will be considered useless.

# Introduction

The purpose of this report is to present a detailed implementation plan for an urban roof farm in Indianapolis. The goal of this project is to support the Indianapolis Public Schools by providing fresh, healthy produce for their students and staff. This urban roof farm will be designed to grow a variety of crops, including arugula, basil, bush beans, chamomile, cilantro, collard greens, curled mustard greens, dill, kale, lavender, lemon balm, mint, mizuna, oakleaf lettuce, romaine, spinach, and Swiss chard.

This urban roof farm will utilize a Kratky hydroponics system, which is an effective and efficient method of growing crops in an urban setting. Additionally, passive solar tunnels will be used to optimize the available sunlight and maximize crop yields.

To ensure that this urban roof farm aligns with the School Urban Farming Framework, a rigorous site assessment and selection process was conducted. The final site was chosen based on its structural integrity, exposure to sunlight, and accessibility.

The following report will detail the design and planning of the urban roof farm, including the layout, irrigation and drainage systems, and equipment needed. It will also include a budget and financing plan, as well as a marketing and outreach strategy to engage the community and promote the benefits of urban farming. Finally, monitoring and evaluation methods will be discussed to track the success of the project and identify areas for improvement.

Overall, this urban roof farm will not only provide fresh produce for Indianapolis Public Schools but will also serve as a model for future urban farming projects in the area.

# Design and Planning

This section should outline the design and planning process for the urban roof farm. This should include the layout of the garden, the types of crops you will grow, and the irrigation and drainage systems. You should also consider the type of containers and soil you will use and any other equipment or tools you will need.
